# Check Lists

## Start of Day
## Before workshop starts
- [ ] Helpers need to stay behind or next to learners and keep their eyes on the sticky notes
- [ ] The second instructor should keep an eye on helpers - (some of them get a bit lazy and hide behind their laptops, that is not why we pay them!)
- [ ] As people come in ask whether intend to use their own installations of software. There will only be a few minutes to help them if necessary otherwise they'll have to use JupyterHub.

## All workshops
- [ ] Welcome all learners.
- [ ] Introduce yourself.
- [ ] Welcome and introduce all other instructors and helpers.
- [ ] Introduce the RSE Team activities. (We still need a slide for this.)
- [ ] Make group aware of Carpentries Code of Conduct.
- [ ] Make group aware of workshop website and link to CoC.
- [ ] Have users navigate to the collaboration document (HackMD or Etherpad).
- [ ] Paste the CoC link and the link to the workshop website at the top of the document.
- [ ] Ask all learners to complete the pre-workshop survey if they have not already done so.
- [ ] Paste the link to the pre-workshop survey in the collaboration document.
- [ ] Give the learners 10 minutes to complete the survey.
- [ ] Explain live coding.
- [ ] Tell them to ask for help at any time. They can either interrupt the instructor or ask a helper.
- [ ] Explain the use of sticky notes. In stead of sticking their hands up they should use the red/orange sticky note. (You can't type with one hand).

## For a workshop using JupyterHub:
- [ ] Paste the Jupyterhub URL, [jh.jannetta.com](jh.jannetta.com) in the collaboration document.
- [ ] Ask everyone to open a browser and navigate to jh.jannetta.com.
- [ ] Explain that learners need to use their student or staff login for a username. THEN CREATE A PASSWORD by typing it into the password box. Whatever you type in the first time you login, will become your password.

## End of Day
- [ ] Leave 15 minutes at the end of the day for learners to complete the post-workshop survey. (This is only for the last day of the workshop)
- [ ] If not the last day of the workshop have learner complete: 1) What have we done well. 2) What can we improve on. Use either the collaboration document or Slido. You can also have them use their sticky notes.
