Software and Data Carpentry Workshops @ NCL are organised and presented by the Newcastle University's [Research Software Engineering Team](https://rse.ncldata.dev/).

The aim of these workshops are to teach foundational coding and data skills to researchers across the university. No prior knowledge of the material is required.

The workshop follows the format of the [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org)

All members of our RSE Team are certified Software Carpentry Instructors (or in the process of becoming certified if they are new to the team). Our training lead, [Dr. Jannetta Steyn](https://rse.ncldata.dev/jannetta-steyn) is also a Carpentry Instructor Trainer.
